In rows **2 and below**, enter sample item data:

| Item     | Quantity | Price per Item |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Item 1   | 10       | $20            |
| Item 2   | 5        | $15            |
| Item 3   | 20       | $10            |

Total Cost > $100: Highlight these cells in a light color.

### 7. Discounted Items (Column E = "Yes"): Highlight to easily identify discounts.



### 8. Save Your Work
Once everything looks good, don't forget to save your Excel workbook.
